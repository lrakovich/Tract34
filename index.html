<!---------------INTRO------------------>



<div class="intro"><p>Tract 34 of Providence, RI, known as the  Blackstone Park Historic District, can be broken roughly into three vertical strips. Going from West to East, you would first pass through a heavily residential area where life, or at least living, is the main purpose – beautiful homes, people walking along the boulevard, cyclists riding by, and hardly any places of work or commerce. Continuing westward, you would reach Swan Point Cemetery, a historical cemetery established in 1846. Despite its spacious appearance on the map, in stark contrast to the tightly-packed residential streets, it’s home to over forty-thousand residents. Further beyond is the Seekonk River.</p>

<p>As we explored the three parts of Blackstone, we gradually began noticing that their differences highlight their commonalities, and vice versa. Signs of life abound in the <a href="#distancegif">residential</a> streets and Swan Point’s avenues, both as literal testaments of lives being lived and having had lived, and as systems of symbols, asynchronous <a href="#project-cemeterystroll">conversations</a> being carried through <a href="#project-stars">space</a> and time. In a way, the cemetery is a place where distance is <a href="#project-distance">flattened</a>, each <a href="#project-qingming">gravestone</a> a portal where multiple points become one. The effects of time can be seen and heard everywhere, as <a href="#project-">wind</a> rustles through the leaves in quiet front yards, as wind <a href="#project-">erodes</a> stone, as stones cast in water send <a href="#project-ripples">ripples</a> along its surface, spreading wider, wider, until they become flush with the surface once again, no longer seen, and the stones remain <a href="#project-stone">hidden</a>, there and not-there.</p>

<p>This is a census of the living and the dead.</p>

<p>—Louis Rakovich & Zoey Guo, 2020

     <div class="mythology">

        <p>The name Arcturus is derived from the Greek word Αρκτοῦρος, which means "Guardian of the Bear".
       </p>
        <p>In mythology, Zeus fell in love with Lycaon’s daughter, Callisto, and gave birth to Arcas. Zeus's wife Hera knew this and turned Callisto into a bear. When Arcas grew up, he reunited in Kassto in the forest, but he didn't know that the bear was his mother. He aimed his arrow at the bear. At this time, Zeus transformed Arcas into a bear like his mother and put them into the sky.  They became Ursa Major and Ursa Minor. Arcturus was created to guard them.
       </p>
         <div class="mythology2">
          <p>Ursa Major is often used as an important navigational sign. Observers in the northern hemisphere can find Arcturus along the direction indicated by the arc of Ursa Major. If you find Ursa Major in the night sky, you can always find your way home.

       <p>In my hometown, when I was a child, I was told that when my loved ones died, they would become one of the stars in the sky and still watched over me. When I look up into the night sky, the brightest star is the loved one I miss the most.

      <p id="gravestone-text">Death divides the world into two parts. The living and the dead are trapped in their own worlds. A gravestone is the only medium that is used to connect the two worlds. The only day that I could talk to them was Qingming Festival. During Qingming, my family would visit the cemetery to pray to our ancestors and chat with them about events that had happened in the recent days without them.

        <p>Homo sapiens have been hunting and gathering together since prehistoric times. Then there were clans, settlements, religions, and states. Until now, everyone is an individual, enjoying freedom while we still live in the city, surrounded by friends and family. The natural gravity between us always brings each of us to one another. We are free to control this gravity. We are open to deciding when to approach others to seek comfort and obtain warmth and be alone, away from crowds for the joy of alone. We are used to balancing our lives and work in this pattern.
        </p>
        <p>We live in crowds and enjoy solitude, but we cannot live without crowds as long as we live.
        </p>
        <p>From Uppsala University's psychology department, Emily Holmes said that We are all dealing with unprecedented uncertainty and significant changes to the way we live our lives due to Coronavirus.
        </p>
        <p>Human beings feel anxious about the dramatic change and uncertain future because it creates a sense of crisis. At such times, we turn to others to seek for comfort and security. Lovely smile face, warm hugs, and body touches, physical proximity also brings us closer psychologically to find support for our insecurities. However, due to the forced quarantine and the requirement for masks brought by Coronavirus, simple communication became impossible when we needed each other most.
        </P>
        <p>I hope everything will get back to normal soon. I am able to come close to you, I am also able to come close to them.</P>

   <p>“Spaces available for natural burial are located in the historic core of the cemetery known as the Ellipse. Surrounded by mature trees and shrubs, the land will be kept free of monuments preserving its natural setting. A granite ledger is available for communal inscriptions of names. Every grave space allows for one full body burial, or two sets of cremated remains. Cremated remains must be placed in a biodegradable urn then buried. Both full body and cremation interments will take place without the use of any type of outer container, therefore will be considered permanent and irretrievable.”</p>
